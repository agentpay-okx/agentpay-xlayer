# AgentPay Instructions

Use AgentPay for chat-approved BNB Chain and cross-chain stablecoin payments or guarded same-chain contract calls through the AgentPay MCP server.

If AgentPay tools are unavailable and local command execution is available, ask for explicit approval before running `npx @agentpay-ai/agentpay install`. The installer writes `AgentPayAccount.bin` and points `AGENTPAY_ACCOUNT_BYTECODE_PATH` at it. After the user fills the generated config, run `npx @agentpay-ai/agentpay doctor` to check readiness without printing secrets. Run `npx @agentpay-ai/agentpay setup-web` when the setup/signing page needs to be served. If command execution is unavailable, explain that AgentPay cannot be installed or checked from this session.

Use AgentPay MCP tools only. Never bypass AgentPay with raw RPC calls, manual wallet transfers, raw LI.FI calls, shell scripts, or private-key handling.

Wallet onboarding happens in chat: use `prepare_wallet_creation`, give the setup signing link, then use `check_wallet_creation`. The setup signature proves ownership only; the setup signature is not payment approval and must never be treated as approval to spend.

For invoice payments, call `parse_invoice_payment`, show the parsed fields, and ask the user to confirm they match the invoice before preparing payment with the full returned `paymentInput`, including `paymentType`.

For x402 v2 `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` responses, call `parse_x402_payment_required`, show the parsed resource and selected payment requirement, and continue with the full returned `paymentInput` only if the user understands that standard x402 exact endpoints still require a `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` from an x402-capable signer unless the merchant accepts direct/custom settlement.

For owner controls such as pause, unpause, executor rotation, nonce cancellation, token allowlist changes, or withdrawals, call `prepare_account_admin_transaction` and ask the owner wallet to submit the returned transaction. This is not payment approval.

For same-chain contract calls, call `prepare_contract_call` only after the user confirms the target address, calldata, max token spend, max native fee, and purpose. Show the calldata hash and require the target to be allowlisted.

Payment execution requires exact approval. AgentPay checks source-token balance during quote and preparation; if it reports insufficient balance, explain the top-up required and do not ask for approval. For LI.FI routes and contract-call targets, call `check_route_target_allowance`; if the target is not allowlisted, call `prepare_route_target_allowance` and ask the owner wallet to submit the returned transaction before execution. Prepare first, show all payment details including route target, calldata hash when present, max spend or amount, max native fee, fee, ETA or deadline, and purpose. Ask for the exact approval phrase, and execute only after the user replies with that exact phrase. After `execute_payment`, call `track_payment` before reporting completion. Never accept vague confirmations. Use `list_payment_events` for payment audit history or lifecycle detail.
