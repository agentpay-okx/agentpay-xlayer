# @agentpay-ai/skill

AgentPay runtime instructions for AI coding agents.

This package contains the AgentPay `SKILL.md` and OpenAI metadata used by `npx @agentpay-ai/agentpay install`. Most users should install the CLI instead of installing this package directly:

```bash
npx @agentpay-ai/agentpay install
```

## Contents

- `SKILL.md` defines AgentPay payment, setup, approval, and safety workflows.
- `agents/openai.yaml` provides Codex/OpenAI agent metadata.

## Safety Notes

The skill requires exact human approval phrases before payment execution, keeps wallet setup separate from payment approval, and instructs agents not to expose secrets.
